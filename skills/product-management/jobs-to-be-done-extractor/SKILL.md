description: "Extracts Jobs-to-be-Done statements (functional, emotional, social) from raw research — interviews, surveys, support tickets, sales calls — and produces a job map with progress measures and outcome statements. Use when reframing a product around customer outcomes, segmenting beyond demographics, building a competitive switching analysis, prioritizing features, or aligning product, marketing, and sales on the same job."

# Jobs-to-be-Done Extractor

> Reframes the product around the job the customer is hiring it to do.

## What this skill is

A workflow that turns unstructured customer research into JTBD artifacts: functional + emotional + social job statements, a job map, force diagrams (push / pull / habit / anxiety), outcome statements, and a hire/fire analysis. Built on the Ulwick (ODI) and Christensen schools, with explicit handling of overserved vs. underserved outcomes.

## What it solves

- Persona-based segmentation that doesn't predict purchase behavior
- Roadmaps driven by feature requests instead of customer outcomes
- Marketing copy that lists features but doesn't connect to the job
- Switching analysis that ignores the four forces (push, pull, habit, anxiety)
- Inconsistent JTBD interpretations across product, marketing, and sales

## When to invoke

- Synthesizing customer interviews, switching interviews, or win/loss calls
- Re-segmenting the market beyond firmographics
- Building positioning or messaging that resonates with the actual job
- Prioritizing the roadmap by underserved outcome importance
- Aligning product, marketing, sales, and CS on a shared customer model

## Phase 1: Source the raw material

Catalog what you have:
- Customer interview transcripts (switching, churn, win/loss, discovery)
- Sales call recordings + notes
- Support tickets and CSAT verbatims
- Survey free-text responses
- Reviews (G2, Capterra, Reddit, Twitter)
- Internal Slack from CS / sales

Log source, recency, sample size, and any selection bias.

## Phase 2: Extract the job statements

For each customer signal, write a job statement using the canonical form:

> When [situation], I want to [motivation], so I can [expected outcome].

Categorize each into:
- **Functional** — the practical task being accomplished
- **Emotional** — how the customer wants to feel
- **Social** — how they want to be perceived

Most products serve a primary functional job plus 1–2 emotional / social jobs. Identify the **main job** vs. **related jobs** vs. **little hires**.

## Phase 3: Build the job map

Decompose the main job into Ulwick's 8 universal stages:

| Stage | Question | Example |
|-------|----------|---------|
| Define | What do they need to decide before starting? | |
| Locate | What inputs / context do they need to gather? | |
| Prepare | How do they set up the work? | |
| Confirm | How do they verify they're ready? | |
| Execute | What is the core task? | |
| Monitor | How do they track progress? | |
| Modify | How do they adapt mid-job? | |
| Conclude | How do they finish and clean up? | |

For each stage, list the **desired outcomes** the customer wants to optimize.

## Phase 4: Outcome statements & importance × satisfaction

Convert each desired outcome into a measurable statement:

> [Minimize / Increase] the [unit of measure] [object of control] [contextual clarifier]

Example: *Minimize the time it takes to verify the report matches the source data.*

Score each outcome on 1–10:
- **Importance** — how critical to the customer
- **Satisfaction** — how well current solutions deliver

Plot on the Opportunity Score matrix:

```
Opportunity = Importance + max(Importance − Satisfaction, 0)
```

Outcomes scoring ≥15 are **underserved** (innovation opportunity). Outcomes scoring <10 with high satisfaction are **overserved** (cost-reduction or simplification opportunity).

## Phase 5: Forces of progress analysis

For switching / adoption decisions, map the four forces:

| Force | Pulls toward new | Pulls toward old |
|-------|------------------|------------------|
| Push of the current situation | Frustrations, broken workflows | |
| Pull of the new solution | Promised benefits, identity fit | |
| Anxiety of the new solution | | Switching cost, learning curve, risk |
| Habit of the old | | Inertia, sunk cost, social bonds |

A switch happens when (Push + Pull) > (Anxiety + Habit). Identify which force is the bottleneck and prioritize accordingly.

## Phase 6: Hire / fire analysis

For each segment, identify:
- **Who they hired you over** (direct competitor, workaround, do-nothing)
- **Who they fired to hire you** (incumbent, manual process)
- **What would make them fire you** (deal-breakers, deteriorating outcomes)

## Output

- 5–12 prioritized job statements (functional + emotional + social)
- Job map with 8 stages and desired outcomes per stage
- Opportunity Score matrix flagging underserved and overserved outcomes
- Forces of progress diagram for top switching scenarios
- Hire/fire analysis per segment
- 3–5 messaging seeds for marketing and sales

## Operating rules

**Always**
- Quote customer language verbatim before paraphrasing
- Distinguish functional vs. emotional vs. social
- Score outcomes for both importance and satisfaction
- Use the canonical situation / motivation / outcome statement form
- Map all four forces, not just push and pull

**Never**
- Mix demographic personas with JTBD segments
- Skip the "when" situation — it's where the job lives
- Reduce a job to a feature request
- Anchor on the first interview (verify across multiple sources)
- Confuse the customer's words with their job
