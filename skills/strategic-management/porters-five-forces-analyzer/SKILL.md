description: "Performs a rigorous Porter's Five Forces analysis: industry structure, supplier power, buyer power, threat of new entrants, substitutes, and rivalry intensity, with quantified pressure scoring and a strategic-positioning recommendation. Use when entering a new market, defending an existing position, evaluating an industry's structural attractiveness, advising on M&A in a new vertical, or preparing a competitive strategy memo."

# Porter's Five Forces Analyzer

> Industry-structure analysis that explains why some markets are profitable and others aren't.

## What this skill is

A workflow that applies Michael Porter's Five Forces framework with quantitative pressure scoring (1–5 per force) and the structural drivers behind each score. It surfaces the dominant force, identifies where the company can move the structure in its favor, and produces a positioning recommendation that goes beyond "the industry is attractive / unattractive."

## What it solves

- Industry analysis that stops at "competition is intense" without identifying which force matters most
- Strategy memos that ignore supplier or buyer power
- Treating substitutes only as direct competitors (missing adjacent threats)
- Static analysis with no view on how forces are evolving
- Recommendations disconnected from the structural levers identified

## When to invoke

- Entering a new vertical, geography, or product category
- Pre-M&A diligence in an unfamiliar industry
- Defending current strategy when challenger dynamics shift
- Annual strategic plan industry-context refresh
- Board memo justifying a market exit or entry

## Phase 1: Define the industry boundary

Industries are not obvious — and bad boundary choice invalidates the analysis. Decide:
- **Product / service scope** — what's in, what's out (e.g., "B2B fleet telematics" vs. "vehicle hardware")
- **Geography** — global, regional, country-specific
- **Customer segment** — enterprise vs. SMB; consumer vs. industrial
- **Value chain stage** — manufacturer, distributor, retailer, service provider

Different boundaries can produce different forces. Document the choice explicitly.

## Phase 2: Force 1 — Supplier power

Score 1 (weak) to 5 (strong) and explain drivers:

| Driver | Pushes power UP | Pushes power DOWN |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Supplier concentration | Few, dominant suppliers | Many fragmented suppliers |
| Switching costs | High (proprietary inputs) | Low (commodity) |
| Forward integration threat | Credible | Not feasible |
| Importance of industry to supplier | Small customer for them | Large customer |
| Substitute inputs | None | Many viable |
| Differentiation of inputs | Highly differentiated | Commoditized |

Cite specific suppliers when known (e.g., TSMC for advanced silicon).

## Phase 3: Force 2 — Buyer power

| Driver | Pushes power UP | Pushes power DOWN |
|--------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Buyer concentration | Few large buyers | Many small buyers |
| Switching costs | Low for buyer | High (lock-in, contracts) |
| Backward integration threat | Credible | Not feasible |
| Price sensitivity | Product is large % of buyer's cost | Small share |
| Product differentiation | Commoditized | Highly differentiated |
| Buyer information | Full price transparency | Asymmetric |

Sub-segment buyers — enterprise behaves differently from SMB.

## Phase 4: Force 3 — Threat of new entrants

| Barrier | High barrier | Low barrier |
|---------|--------------|-------------|
| Economies of scale | Required | Not required |
| Capital requirements | Heavy | Light |
| Network effects | Strong | None |
| Switching costs for buyers | High | Low |
| Access to distribution | Locked up | Open |
| Brand / customer loyalty | Strong | Weak |
| Regulatory licenses | Required, scarce | None |
| Proprietary technology / data | Defensible | Replicable |
| Incumbent retaliation | Credible | Unlikely |

Score the **net entry barrier** 1 (low → high entry threat) to 5 (high → low threat).

## Phase 5: Force 4 — Threat of substitutes

Substitutes are alternative solutions to the same customer job — not direct competitors. Examples:
- Video conferencing → in-person meetings, async video, written docs
- Ride-sharing → public transit, walking, owning a car, working from home

| Driver | Pushes threat UP | Pushes threat DOWN |
|--------|------------------|--------------------|
| Substitute price/performance | Improving | Degrading |
| Buyer propensity to substitute | High | Low (entrenched habits) |
| Cost of switching to substitute | Low | High |

Map the **performance trajectory** of substitutes over the next 3–5 years.

## Phase 6: Force 5 — Rivalry intensity

| Driver | Higher rivalry | Lower rivalry |
|--------|---------------|---------------|
| Competitor concentration | Many similarly-sized | Few, with clear leader |
| Industry growth | Slow / declining | Fast |
| Fixed costs / capacity | High (drives price competition) | Low |
| Product differentiation | Low | High |
| Exit barriers | High (forces stay-and-fight) | Low |
| Strategic stakes | High for multiple players | Low |

## Phase 7: Aggregate & dominant force

| Force | Score (1–5) | Dominant drivers | Trajectory (3y) |
|-------|------------:|------------------|-----------------|
| Supplier power | x | | ↑↓→ |
| Buyer power | x | | ↑↓→ |
| New entrants | x | | ↑↓→ |
| Substitutes | x | | ↑↓→ |
| Rivalry | x | | ↑↓→ |

Identify:
- **Dominant force** — the one most depressing industry profitability
- **Industry attractiveness** — sum scores; <12 attractive, 12–18 moderate, >18 difficult
- **Direction of travel** — net force pressure trajectory

## Phase 8: Strategic implications

The point of Five Forces is not just "what's the industry like?" but **what to do about it**. For each force, identify the strategic lever:

| Force | Strategic moves |
|-------|-----------------|
| Supplier power | Vertically integrate, multi-source, build alternatives, build internal capability |
| Buyer power | Differentiate, raise switching costs, segment, build ecosystem |
| Entrants | Raise barriers (scale, network effects, IP), pre-empt, M&A consolidation |
| Substitutes | Improve relative price/performance, redefine the job, partner with substitutes |
| Rivalry | Differentiate, segment, consolidate via M&A, signal credibly to discourage price wars |

## Output

- Five-force scorecard with drivers cited
- Industry boundary statement and trajectory of each force
- Dominant force identification and reasoning
- Industry attractiveness rating
- Strategic recommendation: where to invest to reshape the forces in your favor
- 3 leading indicators to monitor that would change the analysis

## Operating rules

**Always**
- State the industry boundary explicitly
- Score each force on a 1–5 scale with drivers cited
- Identify the dominant force, not a generic "competition"
- Project a 3-year trajectory per force
- Translate analysis into specific strategic moves

**Never**
- Treat Five Forces as a static one-time exercise
- Confuse substitutes with direct competitors
- Conflate industry attractiveness with company performance
- Skip the boundary definition
- Stop at description without recommending action
